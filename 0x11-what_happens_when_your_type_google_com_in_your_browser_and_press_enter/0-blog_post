When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and hit Enter, a series of behind-the-scenes actions unfold seamlessly. Initially, your browser sends a request to a DNS server to translate the web address into an IP address, which serves as the digital location of Google's server. Once the IP address is obtained, your browser establishes a connection using TCP/IP, ensuring reliable data transmission. Along the way, firewalls may inspect the traffic for security purposes. As the connection is established, HTTPS and SSL encryption protocols come into play, safeguarding the data exchanged between your browser and Google's server from prying eyes. Load balancers may distribute the incoming requests among Google's servers for optimal performance. Finally, Google's web server, application server, and database work in tandem to retrieve and deliver the requested webpage or service, completing the journey from a simple browser input to the familiar Google homepage.
